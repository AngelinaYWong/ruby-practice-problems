// Create a function that will return a regular expression string that is capable of evaluating binary strings (which consist of only 1s and 0s) and determining whether the given string represents a number divisible by n.
//
// Tests
// Inputs 1 <= n <= 18 will be tested
//
// Each n will be tested against random invalid tests and random valid tests (which may or may not pass the regex test itself, accordingly).

// Strings that are not binary numbers should be rejected.
// Only these characters may be included in your returned string: 01?:*+^$()[]|
